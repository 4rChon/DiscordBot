# DiscordBot
A toy discord bot

Trains a markov model on chat messages. After a while it will start to generate sentences based on past chat messages.

Some results after being trained on over 10,000 words:

"Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant Barclay being referred to clandestinely as a form of transport.. for their heads."
"Police and rioters come together to help a fat cow and hang up."
"I don't know how to reload"
"Dood, you were watching me when I was a broken jpeg."
